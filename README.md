# VK Kaggle Competition

## Description

Project for search of the best model on sport images classification task.

Competition on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vk-made-sports-image-classification) as a HW of VK MADE CV course

## TODO

1. Train different simple classification models
2. Treat imballance of classes
3. Metric learning
4. Metric learning with latent memory
5. Ways of cheat on testset
